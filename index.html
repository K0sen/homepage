          <p>Jason Statham is an English actor, producer and martial artist. Jason did not want to follow his father’s footsteps. He was a member of the British National Diving Squad for twelve years. He finished 12th in platform diving in the World Championships. He came into the limelight when the agency Sports Promotions signed to model for the clothing brand French Connection. He then appeared in the music videos of bands including The Shamen, Erasure and The Beautiful South. His first movie break came when Guy Ritchie signed him for “Lock, Stock and Two Smoking Barrels” since the character related with Statham’s background. More movie roles soon followed. He became famous for his roles in “Snatch” alongside actors Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina and Benicio del Toro, and “The Expendables” alongside action stars Sylvester Stallone, Jet Li and Mickey Rourke. In “The Transporter” he plays the lead role of Frank Martin. He reprised his role in “Transporter 2” and “Transporter 3”. Known to perform his stunts himself, Statham has advocated for stunt performers to be given their own category at the Oscars.</p>
